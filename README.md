# DomoQuickViz-PDF
Static PDF showing a basic visualization in Domo (simpler version of Tableau) after only 5 minutes of exploring the software.
Because there are so many softwares in the market, my habit is to see how much of a given tool I can learn in a very short space of time.  I was able to create this viz after only 5-10 minutes of work, including exporting as a static PDF.  It is in PDF because by the time you're looking at this my trial period has likely expired.  The full functionality of Domo is ~90% of Tableau's, in a more user-friendly learning curve.
